This is my course project for Coursera's "Getting and Cleaning Data Course." The objective is to take raw data sets, merge them
together, and tidy of the data so that analysis can be performed on the data using R programming. Essentially, this is a project that aims to 
get the student acquianted with all the dirty work before data analysis can be done.

The Repository contains data that is from the following source:
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

The objective of the assignment is to create an R script that does the following:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

This repository also contains the following:

1. The R script named "run_analysis.R
2. The codebook that enables anyone to follow the R script called "CodeBook.md"
3. The data set that has been cleaned up called "tidydata"

There were many online resources used, namely the David Hood's contribution to the Discussion Forum "Davids Project FAQ"
for the Coursera courseproject that onlines an excellent strategy to complete the project. 

Other resources such as Stackoverflow and myriad of google searches was also done to obtain useful information in completing the project
